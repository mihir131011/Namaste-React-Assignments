# Assignment - 3

Question - 1 What is JSX ?

Ans : JSX is the special syntax which was introduced with the goal to easily write HTML using JS, so JSX is converted into objects by react.

JSX is often called as Java Script XML, it acts like syntactic sugar for DOM manipulation.

Question -2 Superpowers of JSX ?

Ans :

1. JSX reduces the pain of writing the lengthy code.
2. JSX saves from XSS attacks by sanitising the code.

Question - 3 Role of type attribute in <script> tag ?

Ans : 

Type Attribute specifies the MIME type of the content between the script tag. The default value is text/javascript. 

**module**

This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is deferred. The `charset` and `defer`attributes have no effect. Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching.

**importantmap**

This value indicates that the body of the element contains an import map. The import map is a JSON object that developers can use to control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps).

**Any other value**

The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. All of the other attributes will be ignored, including the `src` attribute.

Ques - 3: Difference between {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent />} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}

{TitleComponent} is just an idication in the JSX, it will not render the component but it would just point the Component. We need to call that Component in tags.

{<TitleComponent />}  will call the component and this will render in the DOM, but this is the self closing tags. We cannot render anything in between these tags.

{<TitleComponent ></TitleComponent >} we can render some things in between.
